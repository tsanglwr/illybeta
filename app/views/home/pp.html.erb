      rather than Personal Information. Non-identifiable Aggregate Information is  used to tailor your experiences on the Web Site by showing content in which we  think you will be interested and displaying content according to your  preferences. We may use Aggregate Information to analyze user behavior and  characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of  the Web Site.
